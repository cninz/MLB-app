# Bar's Tool MLB Simulation

Collaborated with Max Calkin (#100Devs Cohort) by providing CSS styling to the Fullstack web app where you type in the names of your favorite players, when you click the button it searches the MLB stats API. Then a a very simple math formula  returns a score (usually between 500-1200) based on the player's OPS.  After each team has 9 players, the game ends and whoever's team has more points wins.
