Bar's Tool MLB Simulation

Collaborated Fullstack web app with Max Calkin (#100Devs Cohort) where you type in the names of your favorite players, when you click the button it searches the MLB stats API. Then a a very simple math formula  returns a score (usually between 500-1200) based on the player's OPS.  After each team has 9 players, the game ends and whoever's team has more points wins.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Framework of choice

Here's where you can go to town on how you actually built this thing. Write as much as you can here, it's totally fine if it's not too much just make sure you write *something*. If you don't have too much experience on your resume working on the front end that's totally fine. This is where you can really show off your passion and make up for that ten fold.
